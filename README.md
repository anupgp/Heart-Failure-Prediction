# ü´Ä Heart Disease Prediction Model
This project uses a combined heart disease dataset to develop a predictive model for diagnosing the presence of heart disease based on clinical features. A Random Forest Classifier is trained and evaluated for performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, Confustion Matric. The results are further illustrated with data visualizations and analysis, supporting explainability and clinical insight.


## ‚úÖ Purpose & Overview
The objective of this project is to:
- Develop a machine learning model for predicting heart disease.
- Identify significant predictors contributing to heart disease.
- Provide intuitive visualizations through tools like Plotly Dash to support model interpretability for both technical and non-technical audiences.

A cleaned dataset combining five heart-related datasets serves as the input, and Random Forest Plot regression was chosen for data modeling. 

## Dataset Overview 
The final dataset contains 918 unique patient records drawn from five publicly available sources:

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

![Summary of age and gender influence on heart disease] (Figures /Age vs Heart Disease and Heart Disease vs. Gender .png)

The figure contains two subplots analyzing the relationships between age, gender, and heart disease. The first subplot, **Age vs Heart Disease Distribution**, presents a histogram illustrating the counts of individuals with and without heart disease across different age groups. It shows that people without heart disease (blue bars) are fairly evenly distributed across ages, with some peaks around ages 48 and 55. In contrast, individuals with heart disease (orange bars) tend to be concentrated in the middle age range, particularly between ages 50 and 60, with a peak around age 55. This indicates that the occurrence of heart disease generally increases with age, especially in the 50-60 age bracket. The second subplot, **Heart Disease vs Gender**, highlights that males (represented by '1') have a significantly higher count of heart disease cases‚Äî458‚Äîcompared to females, who have only 50 cases. Males without heart disease number 143, suggesting a higher prevalence of heart disease among males in this dataset. Overall, the data suggests that heart disease prevalence rises with age and is more common in males than females.


This visualization aids in understanding the relationship between age and the occurrence of heart disease, suggesting the importance of age as a factor in medical assessments and preventive strategies.



## üß™ Model Development

The model selection process follows these steps: 

1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Encoding**: Categorical values are encoded using mapping and one-hot encoding.  
2. **Scaling**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` for model fitting.  
3. **Train-Test Split**: Data is split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets with stratification.  
4. **Model Training**: A `LogisticRegression` model is used in a `Pipeline`.  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation.

## Ethical Considerations

- The dataset is anonymized, posing low privacy risks.  
- Ensure visualizations are inclusive (colorblind-friendly palettes, clear labeling).  
- Communicate model limitations and avoid overreliance in a real-world clinical setting.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more complex models such as Random Forest or XGBoost for comparison.  
- Deploy a real-time prediction interface using Streamlit or Dash.  
- Perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction using PCA or Lasso.
