## Exploratory Data Analysis 


![Heart Disease Age Distribution](/Users/khrystynaplatko/Desktop/Heart-Failure-Prediction/Figures/Screenshot%202025-07-24%20at%207.13.59%20PM.png)


This histogram illustrates the age distribution of individuals diagnosed with and without heart disease. The data is categorized into two groups: those with heart disease (indicated in blue) and those without (indicated in red).

1. **Age Peaks**:
   - Individuals with heart disease primarily fall within the age range of around 60 years, showcasing a peak in this demographic.
   - Conversely, individuals without heart disease tend to cluster around the 50-year mark.

2. **Age Spread**:
   - The distribution for those with heart disease is broader, extending into the older age groups more prominently than those without.
   - The distribution for those without heart disease is slightly more compact, with fewer older individuals.

3. **Comparative Density**:
   - Higher density of older individuals (between 50 to 70 years) is observed in the blue group (with heart disease).
   - Younger individuals (under 50 years) are more prevalent in the red group (without heart disease).

4. **Implications**:
   - The data suggests a correlation between age and the prevalence of heart disease, highlighting that the risk increases with age.

This visualization aids in understanding the relationship between age and the occurrence of heart disease, suggesting the importance of age as a factor in medical assessments and preventive strategies.



## üß™ Model Development

The model selection process follows these steps: 

1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Encoding**: Categorical values are encoded using mapping and one-hot encoding.  
2. **Scaling**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` for model fitting.  
3. **Train-Test Split**: Data is split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets with stratification.  
4. **Model Training**: A `LogisticRegression` model is used in a `Pipeline`.  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

Key trends and insights:
- **Age**: Normally distributed across the population.  
- **Sex Distribution**: Majority male, indicating gender imbalance.  
- **Chest Pain Type**: Most common is 'ASY' (Asymptomatic).  
- **Feature Correlation**: Oldpeak and ST_Slope show notable associations with heart disease.

Planned visualizations:
- Bar chart of absolute logistic regression coefficients  
- Heatmap showing correlations among features  
- Boxplots comparing key variables across disease status groups

## üé® Data Visualization Objectives

1. **Explore Data Distributions**  
   - Age, sex, chest pain by disease outcome

2. **Examine Feature Relationships**  
   - Boxplots (e.g., Oldpeak vs HeartDisease)  
   - Correlation heatmap

## üìö Tech Stack & Libraries

| Library        | Purpose                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `pandas`       | Data manipulation                        |
| `numpy`        | Numerical computations                   |

## Ethical Considerations

- The dataset is anonymized, posing low privacy risks.  
- Ensure visualizations are inclusive (colorblind-friendly palettes, clear labeling).  
- Communicate model limitations and avoid overreliance in a real-world clinical setting.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more complex models such as XGBoost for comparison.  
- Deploy a real-time prediction interface using Streamlit or Dash.  
- Perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction using PCA or Lasso.
