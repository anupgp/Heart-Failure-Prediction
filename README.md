# ü´Ä Heart Disease Prediction Model
This project uses a combined heart disease dataset to develop a predictive model for diagnosing the presence of heart disease based on clinical features. A Random Forest Classifier is trained and evaluated for performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, Confustion Matric. The results are further illustrated with data visualizations and analysis, supporting explainability and clinical insight.


## ‚úÖ Purpose & Overview
The objective of this project is to:
- Develop a machine learning model for predicting heart disease.
- Identify significant predictors contributing to heart disease.
- Provide intuitive visualizations through tools like Plotly Dash to support model interpretability for both technical and non-technical audiences.

A cleaned dataset combining five heart-related datasets serves as the input, and Random Forest Plot regression was chosen for data modeling. 

## Dataset Overview 
The final dataset contains 918 unique patient records drawn from five publicly available sources:

## Exploratory Data Analysis 



## üß™ Model Development

The model selection process follows these steps: 

1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Encoding**: Categorical values are encoded using mapping and one-hot encoding.  
2. **Scaling**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` for model fitting.  
3. **Train-Test Split**: Data is split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets with stratification.  
4. **Model Training**: A `LogisticRegression` model is used in a `Pipeline`.  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation.


### Optimal Parameters Used

## Ethical Considerations

- The dataset is anonymized, posing low privacy risks.  
- Ensure visualizations are inclusive (colorblind-friendly palettes, clear labeling).  
- Communicate model limitations and avoid overreliance in a real-world clinical setting.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more complex models such as Random Forest or XGBoost for comparison.  
- Deploy a real-time prediction interface using Streamlit or Dash.  
- Perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction using PCA or Lasso.
